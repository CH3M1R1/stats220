## Analyzing Student Laptop Usage and Activities

This analysis explores device usage, activities, and screen counts among University of Auckland students to identify common study habits and device preferences. It provides insights into the types of devices students prefer and how they spend their time on campus. Additionally, this analysis helps determine whether the new monitors installed around the university are being effectively utilised.

```{r}
# Load tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

# Inputting the CSV file into rstudio
logged_data <- read_csv("/cloud/project/STATS 220 - Project 2 (Responses) - Form responses 1.csv")

# Renaming variables
latest_data <- logged_data %>%
  rename(
    Timestamp = 'Timestamp',
    Device_type = 'What type of laptop was the student using?',
    Activity = 'What were they doing',
    Screen_count = 'How many screens were they using?'
  )

# _DATA EXPLORATION_

# Counts how many total amount of screens 
total_screens <- sum(latest_data$Screen_count)

# Counts how many data was recorded
data_count <- nrow(latest_data)

# Average number of screens students used
average_screens <- mean(latest_data$Screen_count)

# Printing summary values
paste0("Data count:", data_count)
paste0("Total screens used by students:", total_screens)
paste0("Average screens used by students:", average_screens)

# _BAR CHARTS_

# Bar Chart 1 - Counting student device types
device_bar <- ggplot(latest_data, aes(x = Device_type, fill = Device_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  labs(
    title = "Student Laptop Types",
    x = "Device",
    y = "Students"
  )

print(device_bar)

# Bar Chart 2 - Student activities
activity_bar <- ggplot(latest_data, aes(x = Activity, fill = Activity)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  labs(
    title = "Student Activity",
    x = "Student Activity",
    y = "Students"
  )

print(activity_bar)
