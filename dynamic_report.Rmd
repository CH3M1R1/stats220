## Analyzing Student Laptop Usage and Activities

This analysis explores device usage, activities, and screen counts among University of Auckland students to identify common study habits and device preferences. It provides insights into the types of devices students prefer and how they spend their time on campus. Additionally, this analysis helps determine whether the new monitors installed around the university are being effectively utilised.
