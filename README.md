# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Information and Technology Management ....
- I am taking STATS 220 because I dont have a choice and it seems fun....
- I am interested in learning about R language and to strengthen my abilities in writing in HTML....
